		<b>Where were you during COVID-19?</b>
		<br>
	<br>
    I was and still am incredibly grateful to be working at Trader Joe's, a grocery leader in the COVID-19 response. That is me sanitizing carts and adding to the stack for customers. Word had traveled in the Annapolis area that our store was a leader in the response to COVID-19 and I happened to be at the right place at the right time when a reporter stopped by to take pictures back in March, when this all started. 
<br>
	<br>
I have always been a fan of Trader Joe’s delicious, low cost products and their vibrant, friendly culture which guided my intuition to apply for a job there. Changing perspectives from loyal customer to crew member has deepened my respect and love of this company.
<br>
	<br>
In addition to their products, sustainability efforts, daily donations to homeless shelters, and incredible benefits - the way that I have been treated by our management team has been nothing short of appreciation, respect, and gratitude.
<br>
	<br>
I started working at Trader Joes in October, right before the holidays started. I still remember other crew members telling me that the holidays were the craziest and busiest time that I would experience at TJ’s. They were definitely eventful, but I enjoyed seeing what customers trekked far and wide to buy that they could only find during November/December. My captain also cooked lots of holiday meals for us so we could try the product and give the customer our honest opinions.
<br>
	<br>
Fast forward to March when the governor announced school closings, and our store felt like the holidays 10x but on a Thursday. It was definitely a different time with constant changes daily. From the closing of public schools to shelter in place, the responses at our store put the safety of our crew member and customers first. We changed business hours, changed our bagging policy, created a senior shopping time, put a crew member on cart sanitizing duty for all hours, and started a line policy outside to ensure social distancing.
<br>
	<br>
Working at Trader Joes has definitely given me an interesting vantage point, and while some days are more tiring than others, I am still very grateful that it has brought normal-ness to my routine. While many are facing lack of social interaction during quarantine, I am additionally grateful that I still get to participate in that (at a distance) working here :)
