      Understanding the Problem
  	</h1>
  	<p>
	Trader Joes does not currently have a mobile app, but they do have a great website! I wanted to design an idea for a mobile app that bridged the gap between the insightful information found on their website with a new opportunity to connect with their customers due to COVID. 
	<br>
	Trader Joes engages with their customers through multiple senses including: the hand drawn art found on all of their signs and throughout the store, the smell of savory/sweet blends in their demo station immediately when you walk into the store, and the engagement with crew members throughout the entire shopping experience to ensure excellent customer service!
	<br>
	Due to COVID, we unfortunately had to close our demo station, change our bagging policy, and limit the amount of customers inside the store. These are changes that some customers are still not aware of and changes that create an opportunity for a different way to engage with each other. 
	<br>
	My goal was to merge what is already existing (Announcements, Recipes, New Products, the Fearless Flyer, Podcast) with new ideas that achieve Trader Joeâ€™s mission to provide their customers with value and an enriching connection to their community. These are the areas that I wanted to target: 
	<br>
	<b>Existing</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Updates on operational changes (for i.e. senior hours, bag policy)</li>
		<li>New Products (through Fearless Flyer or Podcast) that customers can read/listen to in line</li>
	</ul>
	<b>New</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Pick-Up option</li>
		<!-- Expedite pace in/out of store
		Introduce unknown customers to prices -->
		<li>Watch an artist design a sign<li>
		<li>For the Kids<li>
	</p>
