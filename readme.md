I created my website application using the Yelp Fusion API Code Sample for Node.js (from Yelp Fusion Github) and Google Maps Geolocation API.

Being a total newbie to web development, I have a lot that I still need to improve from this project. My biggest issues were that I could output the JSON information from the Yelp Fusion API to Git Bash but not to the webpage in the table that I created. In addition, I also need to learn how to connect the user input from the search box to the "term" variable and the location (from Google Maps) to the "location" variable in my sample.js code so that the JSON output matches to the user's preferences instead of the generic variables in the code.

I had a lot of fun working on this project!! I had never worked on any projects using Javascript/HTML/CSS and I loved that this project gave me exposure to working and learning about Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS. I've been told over and over that you should work on something that interests you and furthering my toolset and knowledge in these frameworks opens a door of so many possibilities and applications!!

Thank you so much Capital One!! I would love the opportunity to participate in your summer summit and learn more!
